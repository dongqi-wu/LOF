This is a realization of a bad data detection algorithm developed by Dr.Wu and Dr.Xie, source:

Meng Wu and Le Xie, (2016), Online Detection of Low-Quality Synchrophasor Measurements: A Data-Driven Approach, 
IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, Vol.32, pp. 2817-2827

This application provides a clear demostration of the effectiveness of the LOF analysis algorithm discussed in the paper above,
allowing users to import their own .csv timeseries measurement data and see the detection result from this algorithm.
